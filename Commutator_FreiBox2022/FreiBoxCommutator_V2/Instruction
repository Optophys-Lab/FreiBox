Uploading Done!
In this version, we changed the 3d-printed design of the FreiBox commutator to facilitate the assembly and reduce the noise. We changed the 3D-printed gears buy a timing pulley system.
Please note that the detection principle and the Arduino Code is the same as for v1.

Check the 'FreiBoxCommutator_V2 _AssemblyInstruction.pptx' to assemble the commutator!
